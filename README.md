## Introduction
In this project, the task was to create the key components of a system that can plan which
plane an airline uses to fly passengers on each of their flights, and choose which pilots and cabin crew
are rostered for each flight. This is a simplified but representative version of a real problem faced by
airlines and other businesses. The University has consulted with several businesses in other sectors in
the region to develop this kind of software over recent years.

Because large aircraft weigh more and consume more fuel than smaller ones, airlines try to allocate
the smallest aircraft with enough seats to accommodate the booked passengers to a flight. Pilots and
cabin crew, however, are only qualified to operate certain types of aircraft. Such ‚Äútype ratings‚Äù can
take a considerable amount of time and money to obtain, so it is rare for staff to be qualified to
operate all the types of aircraft that an airline may possess.

The rules governing how long and how often airline staff may work are complex and strict. They are
designed to ensure passenger safety, and are negotiated nationally and internationally between pilot
and cabin crew unions and government safety agencies. Thus, deciding which type of plane to fly on a
particular route on a particular day is a complex decision factoring in passenger demand, the
availability of aircraft, and the availability of qualified pilots and cabin crew.

This assignment simulates some of the constraints that could be found when working under when
developing software in industry. I was supplied with certain key interfaces to which my
software must conform, the system will have to operate on data supplied in various formats, as
if it were exported from separate existing, so-called legacy systems. I will have to use specific
libraries to complete the work.

## The System

### Introduction
The assignment is split into three sections:
- [Exporting data from different file types](#Exporting-data-from-different-file-types)  
- [Creating a scheduler](#Creating-a-scheduler) 
- [Scheduler Competition](#Scheduler-Competition) 

### Exporting data from different file types
The first part of the assignment was to take the different formats that legacy system could create and convert them to Java Objects. The following are the different types that were converted.
- Exporting Aircraft data from **CSV**
- Exporting Employee data from **JSON**
- Exporting Route data from **XML**
- Exporting Flight Booking data from **SQLite Database**

#### Test Results
Once the data was converted it was then tested against three different tests see **[HERE](#test-log)** for the complete test log.  
Here are the results from the tests below:
|             Section              | Tests Failed | Tests Passed |
| :------------------------------: | :----------: | :----------: |
|     Aircraft Data Exporting      |      0       |      16      |
|       Crew Data Exporting        |      0       |      17      |
| Passenger Numbers Data Exporting |      0       |      8       |
|       Route Data Exporting       |      0       |      17      |
|            Scheduler             |      0       |      2       |
|  **Schedule Competition Score**  | 985,379,178  |

### Creating a scheduler
This section required me to use all the exported data from the previous classes and write a new method that allocates and generates a schedule specifying which aircraft will be used on which route on which days, and which pilots and cabin crew will staff the flight.

For a schedule to be valid, every flight in the time period must be allocated a plane and a full crew.
A full crew is defined as a captain, first officer and at least the minimum number of cabin crew for
the aircraft type (see the getRequiredCrew() method in the Aircraft class). In addition, no crew
member or plane may be allocated to two flights at the same time (i.e. if any part of two flights
overlap).

### Scheduler Competition
The final marks on this assessment will be allocated by way of a competition. All students whose
work generates a valid schedule (i.e., with a plane and full crew scheduled to undertake each flight,
and no plane/crew in two places at once) will be entered into the competition. In the competition,
your scheduler will be allowed a maximum of two minutes to create the best schedule possible. Once
two minutes have elapsed, your scheduler will be stopped, and the best schedule it has created will be
assessed to generate a points score. 

Marks will be awarded as follows:
 
### Competition Prize Marks Table
|   Finishing Position    |  Marks   |
| :---------------------: | :------: |
| Bottom 50% of schedules | 5 Marks  |
|  Top 50% of schedules   | 7 Marks  |
|  Top 25% fo schedules   | 10 Marks |
|  Top 10% of schedules   | 15 Marks |

My submission was within the top 50% of the competition which throughout the whole year meant it was position in the top 4% as the competition has very hard to enter.
